# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
		This project works with a dataset from 4115 kickstarter (fund raising) campaigns from 2009 to 2017 and from 21 different countries. 
	Filtering the data for the purpose of this project, we end up analyzing only about a quarter of the data entries that are specific to theater and plays kickstarters.
		

### Purpose
	
		The purpose of this project was to help Louise gain insight to how other fundraising campaigns fared compared to the fundraising done for Louise's play "Fever".
	While more analysis can be done, this project focused on two main topics: 
	1.) Outcomes of Theater Kickstarters Based on Launch Date (Month).
	2.) Outcomes of Play Kickstarters Based on Goals. 	
	


## Analysis and Challenges
	All data, charts, and graphs can be found in the Kickstarter_Challenge Excel workbook.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


	The Theater outcomes based on launch date, categorizes kickstarters into three types of outcomes:
		1.) Successful
		2.) Failed
		3.) Canceled
	Note: any Live kickstarters were ignored, but the data is still available in the KickStarter sheet in the Kickstarter_Challenge Excel workbook.
	
	Looking at the graph Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, we can see a few things for each of the three types of outcomes:
	
		1.) Successful Kickstarters
			a.) Are more common starting in May and start to drop off to average again in August. 
				i.) This could be do to summer months being more active for people being out to engage with.
				ii.) School is not in session, so more people are likely to have time to attend theater productions where fundraising flyers are.
			b.) December has the lowest amount of successful kickstarters launched. 
				i.) This could be that the holidays are typically a busy and expensive time of year. Not leaving much time and money to contribute to the kickstarters, leaving the fundraising to be stalled out of the gate.
			c.) It feels important to note that for the increase in the summer and decrease at the end of the year, the Successful kickstarters total counts increase/decrease even as a percentage of the total kickstarters launched that month
			d.) There are two months that don't follow the expected trend line:
				i.) February has 63% of kickstarters being successful out of total project launch that month. This percentage is above average and is the second largest month to month percentage change.
				ii.) October shows an increase in successful kickstarters from September going against the downward trend from summer to December, but the percentage of successful kickstarters is only 57%, the second lowest.  
		2.) Failed Kickstarters
			a.) The failed trendline is relatively flat compared with the successful trend line.
				i.) This shows that even though the months where more kickstarters where launched (May-July), there is not an increase in failures.
			b.) October sticks out in the failed trendline as well.
				i.) It tells the same but opposite story as the successful October point. It goes against the trendline and has a proportional increase of launches to failures.
		3.) Canceled Kickstarters
			a.) The data for the Canceled Kickstarters shows that regardless of the time of launch, very few kickstarters get canceled.
				i.) This makes sense, why would you stop asking for money before the deadline to have the money.
				
				

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimmer3-iii/kickstarter-analysis/5104d07f73c0b702ca7c170c16203879ce2249cd/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

	The Plays Outcomes based on goals, shows the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters based on what the kickstarter's fundraising goal was.
		The goal categories were separated by roughly $5000 increments. 
	Note: any Live kickstarters were ignored, but the data is still available in the KickStarter sheet in the Kickstarter_Challenge Excel workbook.
		
		1.) Successful Kickstarters
			a.) Successful percentages follow an inversely proportional trend to the goal amount.
				i.) The range between $35,000 to $44,999 has a large increase that goes against this.
				ii.) It is possible that the goals should be separated further into two categories: 1.) Small Goals and 2.) Large Goals. This could mean there is two types of backers that contribute differently based on project size, but that after a certain amount the goal becomes too lofty and the kickstarter is less likely to be successful.
				
		2.) Failed Kickstarters
			a.) Failed percentages show the exact mirror of the successful percentage.
				i.) Doesn't tell us much but validates what we see in the successful launches.
				
		3.) Canceled Kickstarts
			a.) Only note is there are none.
				i.) Plays may get canceled but why would you cancel the kickstarters before the deadline.
				
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	There were two large challenges in completing this project:
	    1.) Not knowing enough about Louise's play or Louise's goals for this analysis. It is hard to complete an analysis of data without having a goal of what the analysis is trying to show.
		2.) The project tasks not including enough analysis to paint a full picture or worse a misleading one.
			a.) Example is on the Theater Outcomes Base on Launch Date there was no percentage of launch type to the grand total of launch each month. Looking purely at the graph it could be concluded that October is an average month for successful project when in fact it has the second worst successful percentage.
			
		

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
	1.) Summer months have more successful launches, not just by count by also by percentage of launches.
	2.) Winter has the least amount of successful launch, but if you had to launch in winter November has the highest successful percentage of launches.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
	There are two types of fundraising kickstarters: 1.) Small goals/productions that start less than $1000 and 2.) Large goals/productions that start around $35,000.
Both types tend to have higher success rate the closer the goal is to the start of the category (meaning the smaller the goal for that category).  	

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
	Two things not included in this dataset that would be helpful for further analysis are:
	1.) A category of how the kickstarter was ran (i.e., online, in person, mix).
	2.) Specifically for the play/theater, what was the size of production/cost. 
	 	i.) The overall production cost. (i.e., was the goal 100% of the play/theater cost or was the goal a smaller 15% of production)  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 
	Tables/graphs that include outcomes based on:
		1.) Length of fundraising.
		2.) Average backer contribution.
		3.) Which countries the kickstarter was in.
		4.) Expanding the launch date separated by year and months.
